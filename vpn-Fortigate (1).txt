! Amazon Web Services
! Virtual Private Cloud

! AWS utilizes unique identifiers to manipulate the configuration of 
! a VPN Connection. Each VPN Connection is assigned an identifier and is 
! associated with two other identifiers, namely the 
! Customer Gateway Identifier and Virtual Private Gateway Identifier.
!
! Your VPN Connection ID 		         : vpn-0c02c922da04dd100
! Your Virtual Private Gateway ID    : vgw-0fb05435afee6259f
! Your Customer Gateway ID		       : cgw-070f793b05881348c
!
!
! This configuration consists of two tunnels. Both tunnels must be 
! configured on your Customer Gateway.
!
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! IPSec Tunnel #1
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #1: Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Configuration
!
! A policy is established for the supported ISAKMP encryption, 
! authentication, Diffie-Hellman, lifetime, and key parameters.
! Please note, these sample configurations are for the minimum requirement of AES128, SHA1, and DH Group 2.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14. 
! You will need to modify these sample configuration files to take advantage of AES256, SHA256, or other DH groups like 2, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24. 
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
!
! The address of the external interface for your customer gateway must be a static address. 
! Your customer gateway may reside behind a device performing network address translation (NAT). 
! To ensure that NAT traversal (NAT-T) can function, you must adjust your firewall rules to unblock UDP port 4500. If not behind NAT, we recommend disabling NAT-T. 
!
! Configuration begins in root VDOM.

! #2: IPSec Configuration
! 
! The IPSec transform set defines the encryption, authentication, and IPSec
! mode parameters.
!
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! Please note, you may use these additionally supported IPSec parameters for encryption like AES256 and other DH groups like 2, 5, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".

Go to VPN-->IPSec--> AutoKey, create Phase 2

 a. Name   :  vpn-0c02c922da04dd100-0 ! Name must be shorter than 15 chars, best if shorter than 12
 b. Phase 1:  vpn-0c02c922da04dd100-0

! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #3: Tunnel Interface Configuration
!  
! A tunnel interface is configured to be the logical interface associated  
! with the tunnel. All traffic routed to the tunnel interface will be 
! encrypted and transmitted to the VPC. Similarly, traffic from the VPC
! will be logically received on this interface.
!
!
! The address of the interface is configured with the setup for your 
! Customer Gateway.  If the address changes, the Customer Gateway and VPN 
! Connection must be recreated with Amazon VPC.
!
! This is required in order for tunnel failover via gwdetect to function
!
! Perform this from the Global VDOM.

Go to Network Tab -—> Interface --> wan1 and edit vpn-0c02c922da04dd100-0

 a. IP : 169.254.53.98
 b. Remote IP: 169.254.53.97
 c. Select Ping
 d. Administrative Status: Up
 e. Select Ok.

!You can set MTU and MSS on the tunnel by performing this from the CLI:
 config global
 config system interface
  edit "vpn-0c02c922da04dd100-0"
    set mtu 1427 
    set tcp-mss 1379
   next 


! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #4 Static Route Configuration
!
! Your Customer Gateway needs to set a static route for the prefix corresponding to your 
! VPC to send traffic over the tunnel interface.
! An example for a VPC with the prefix 10.0.0.0/16 is provided below:
! 
! This is configured from the root VDOM
!
Go to Router Tab --> Static --> Static Route, and click on Create New

 a. Destination IP/Mask: 10.0.0.0/16
 b. Device: vpn-0c02c922da04dd100-0
 c. Select Ok

! Static routing does not allow for failover of traffic between tunnels. If there is a problem with one of the 
! tunnels, we would want to failover the traffic to the second tunnel. This is done by using "gwdetect" in fortigate. 
! The gwdetect command will ping the other end of the tunnel, and check if the tunnel is up. If the pings fail, it will
! remove the static route from the routing table, and the second route in the table will become active. 
! 
! This can be done only using the CLI.
!
! The following config will tell the Fortigate device, what IP it should ping to test the tunnel. This IP should be 
! the inside IP address of the virtual private gateway.
! This is required in order for tunnel failover via gwtect to function. Additionally, this is required to keep the tunnel up, since
! traffic must be sent from your side of the VPN tunnel to prevent the tunnel from being taken down.

config vdom
    edit root
        config router gwdetect
        edit 1
        set interface "vpn-0c02c922da04dd100-0"
        set server "169.254.53.97"

! Using the following command, you can set the interval and failtime for gwdetect. Interval is number of seconds 
! between pings. Failtime is the number of lost consecutive pings.Using the respective values of 2 and 5, your tunnel 
! will failover in 10 seconds.

        set interval 2
        set failtime 5
    next
end

! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #5: Firewall Policy Configuration
!
! Create a firewall policy permitting traffic from your local subnet to the VPC subnet and vice versa
! This example policy permits all traffic from the local subnet to the VPC.
! 
!This is configured from the root VDOM

Go to Firewall --> Policy --> Policy
1) Create New
   a. Incoming Interface/Zone = internal ! This is the interface out which your local LAN resides
   b. Source Address = all
   c. Outgoing Interface/Zone = "vpn-0c02c922da04dd100-0"
   d. Destination Address = all
   e. Schedule = always
   f. Service = ALL
   g. Action = ACCEPT
   h. Click OK

! Now create a policy to permit traffic going the other way

2) Create New
   a. Incoming Interface/Zone = "vpn-0c02c922da04dd100-0"
   b. Source Address = all
   c. Outgoing Interface/Zone = internal  ! This is the interface out which your local LAN resides
   d. Destination Address = all
   e. Schedule = always
   f. Service = ALL
   g. Action = ACCEPT
   h. Click OK
